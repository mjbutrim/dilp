# dilp (development version)
* Added `view_regressions()` to allow users to easily see their options for preloaded regressions in dilp, lma, temp, and precip.
* Fixed `dilp()` so that the mixed_margins aren't screwing everything up.
* Fixed `dilp()` documentation to properly reference the correct parameter options.

# dilp 1.0.0
* Initial CRAN submission
* `dilp()` given new argument `subsite_cols` to allow multiple tiers of specimen/morphotype organization.
