<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dilp is to help with analysis of quantitative fossil leaf traits. Key functions included are:

-   Digital Leaf Physiognomy - `dilp()`

    -   Estimate mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation using multiple linear regressions.
    

-   Fossil Leaf Mass per Area - `lma()`

    -   Reconstruct leaf mass per area using leaf area and petiole width
    

-   Leaf Margin Analysis - `temp_slr()`

    -   Estimate mean annual temperature using leaf margin analysis
    

-   Leaf Area Analysis - `precip_slr()`

    -   Estimate mean annual precipitation using leaf area analysis
    

## Installation

You can install the stable version of dilp from your R session with:

``` r
install.packages("dilp")
```

You can install the development version of dilp from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mjbutrim/dilp")
```

## Example

Find a basic example of running a DiLP and LMA analysis [in this vignette](https://mjbutrim.github.io/dilp/articles/dilp.html)
