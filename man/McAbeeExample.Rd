\describe{
\item{Site}{Stratigraphic layer or locality}
\item{Specimen Number}{Repository number for individual specimen}
\item{Morphotype}{Morphotype the specimen belongs to}
\item{Measurer comments}{Additional notes about the specimen or its measurements}
\item{Margin}{Whether the margin is toothed (0) or entire (1)}
\item{Petiole Width}{The width of the petiole at the basalmost point of insertion into the leaf lamina}
\item{Blade area}{The reconstructed area of the leaf lamina, not including the petiole}
\item{Blade perimeter}{The length of the perimeter of the leaf lamina, not including the petiole}
\item{Feret}{The diameter of a circle with the same area as the leaf lamina, not including the petiole}
\item{Minimum Feret}{The longest line that can be drawn between two points on the perimeter of a selection that is perpendicular to Feret length.  Approximates blade width.}

\item{Internal raw blade area}{The area of a leaf prepared for tooth measurements with teeth digitally removed.}
\item{Internal raw blade perimeter}{The perimeter of a leaf prepared for tooth measurements with teeth digitally removed.}
\item{Length of cut perimeter}{The total length of all segments of leaf removed from the leaf blade while removing damage during preparation of the leaf.}
\item{no. of primary teeth}{The number of primary teeth along the undamaged perimeter}
